# zsh-jira-checkout-branch
> Zsh plugin for easy navigation between git branches associated with JIRA issues

This is written as a zsh plugin, it also works with bash if you follow the [manual installation instructions](#manually).

## Installation

### As an [Oh My ZSH!](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) custom plugin
